Advocating for our customers and the care they deserve

Written by

November 13, 2024

In order to better understand the full scope of the access challenges across the US for these critical medications, we launched the GLP-1 Supply Tracker so that anyone can be a part of advocating for continued access to the medications they need.

Even as availability fluctuates, branded GLP-1 medications are still challenging to access in the US – which means a huge number of Americans are not able to get their hands on the branded medications their doctors prescribe.

In order to better understand the full scope of the access challenges across the US for these critical medications, we launched the GLP-1 Supply Tracker so that anyone (not just our customers!) can share their challenges and be a part of advocating for continued access to the medications they need. This kind of tool isn’t new. However, given the size and scale we have as a company, we have a responsibility to understand the challenges individuals are experiencing and use our platform to face those challenges, both in our offerings and in our conversations with regulators.

There is an obvious gap in supply for the intense demand for branded GLP-1s in this country.

Drugmakers themselves believe that demand for weight loss solutions will continue to outpace the supply of branded medications. There is no official report that truly captures the impact of shortages on the US, but we conducted research with our own customers and found that nearly 30% of Weight Loss customers who had been prescribed a branded GLP-1 product in the past were unable to fill it because the medication was not available at their pharmacy. Between January 2021 and December 2023, there was a 442% increase in branded semaglutide prescriptions at retail pharmacies, and that number is sure to rise as more people become aware of the many conditions these medications serve and the stigma around treating obesity as a disease recedes.

Our customers have made the access gap clear, so we’ve made it easy for anyone to be a part of advocating for better access to the medications they need.

In just one week, we’re heard from nearly 7,000 individuals through our GLP-1 Supply Tracker that they cannot access their medications, with branded semaglutide being the most challenging to access. We’ve actually been collecting data on access challenges across GLP-1s for 2 months through our intake form. Through that channel, nearly 80,000 customers have told us they cannot access the branded medications they’ve been prescribed. We’re using this data to advocate for our customers: we regularly share updated access information with state and federal regulatory and legislative bodies, so we can ensure they have the information they need when making decisions about nationwide healthcare access. This is part of our responsibility to the millions of customers who trust us with their healthcare.

Compounded GLP-1 medications provide a much-needed solution for the obesity crisis in the US – and our personalized approach is leading to positive outcomes for our customers.

We’re not just using our size and scale to advocate for our customers – we’re also using it to help customers access personalized weight loss solutions at affordable prices. Just because the shortage will end one day does not mean the branded drugs will become accessible for everyone who needs them. 

Compounded GLP-1s not only help meet the intense current demand, but they also provide personalized treatments that can help individuals meet their desired outcomes. Outside of a shortage, compounding serves another purpose (and it has for decades): a personalized treatment for the individual. In weight loss specifically, personalized dosing to mitigate side effects is exactly the type of thing the compounding exemption is built for. Our holistic approach to weight loss is working for our customers, with GLP-1 customers losing an average of 9.3 pounds (around 4.1% of their initial body weight) in their first month, and 90% satisfied with their personalized dosing plan.1

Our data shows that our approach is also sustainable. Only 13% of our compounded GLP-1 customers cancel their treatment subscription in the first month.2 We believe our ability to help so many customers continue with their treatment plan is enhanced by the ability for providers on our platform to prescribe tailored, titrated dosing, which allows providers to help their patients manage side effects by gradually adjusting doses based on individual tolerance. 

Just as our customers trust us with their challenging access experiences, they’re also trusting us with their weight loss journeys. We take our role in their journeys seriously and as more Americans fight for access to these life-changing medications, we’re prepared to partner with them to amplify their voice and get them closer to the care they need.

Achieving Profitability and What Comes Next

February 26, 2024

Hims & Hers can enable every household in the nation to find a level of personalized care that has historically only been available to the wealthiest people.

Since we founded Hims & Hers more than six years ago, our goal has been bold: to make the world feel great through the power of better health. On February 26, we announced Hims & Hers had our first quarter of net income profitability and we expect to surpass $1 billion in revenue and deliver our first full year of net income profitability this year. We’ll make that happen by continuing to build personalized and accessible treatments in each of our core specialties. 

I am more confident than ever in our future and that our approach can enable every household in the nation to find a level of personalized care that has historically only been available to the wealthiest people. 

Here’s how we’re thinking about the year we’ve had and what we think is ahead:

Personalization across our core set of specialties is driving strong, sustainable results:

With a strong focus on personalization, we’ve seen financial success on both the top and bottom line. Revenue increased 65% year over year to $872 million, and more importantly, we’re still drawing and retaining users on our platform and over 1.5 million subscribers were on the platform at the end of 2023—a year over year increase of 48%. We’re continuing to take a disciplined approach to scaling our platform, and that is translating to meaningful success on our bottom line as well: we achieved our first quarter of positive net income on the one-year anniversary of our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.

Our ability to provide access, drive awareness, and offer a personalized solution, is allowing us to scale these new specialties at an incredible pace. 

Today, we are focused on ensuring that our customers have an outstanding personalized experience across five core specialties: Sexual Health, Men's and Women's Dermatology, Mental Health, and Weight Loss. These are some of the most emotionally resonant challenges across society today, and impact over 100 million people in the US alone. Throughout 2023, we consistently provided better access to personalized solutions for our customers, with access to providers and diagnosis happening in days (or sometimes hours!) through Hims & Hers, as opposed to weeks or months through traditional settings.

In 2023, three key elements have placed us in a leadership position in the industry:

Moving beyond generics towards access to personalized solutions and treatments that uniquely address user concerns via new form factors, as well as multi-action capabilities. 
At the end of 2023, 30% of subscribers on our platform are now choosing personalized offerings, like Heart Support, Hard Mints, and updated Men’s Hair Loss solutions, all of which were developed with nationally renowned experts and insights from our data platform. 
The shift toward personalized offerings has been even stronger in newer specialties, with Hers Dermatology subscribers choosing a personalized solution more than 75% of the time at the end of 2023, and subscribers to the new weight loss offering are essentially all opting for a personalized treatment. 
It is clear that personalized solutions are here to stay and we expect each of our key specialties (Hers Dermatology, Mental Health, and Weight Loss) to deliver over $100M in revenue in 2025. 
By leveraging AI capabilities across structured data, we’re improving the user and provider experience on our platform. 

 MedMatch by Hims & Hers, introduced late last year, is powering efficient and effective experiences for the user and providers who come to Hims & Hers. Through  MedMatch by Hims & Hers, we are enabling providers to leverage learnings from hundreds of thousands of interactions across our platform to more efficiently match users with the right treatment, and we are uncovering effective and safe solutions that we believe resonate with our users.

Operational excellence and scale enable us to offer impactful solutions to our customers at an accessible price. 

In the fourth quarter, we completed our transition to affiliated pharmacies, which sets the stage to eliminate a substantial barrier for users across our specialties today: cost. Close to 90% of orders on our platform are going through affiliated pharmacies, which allows us to more efficiently scale and ultimately pass value back to customers who have previously been spending too much on—or haven’t been able to afford— the treatments and solutions that we believe can have an outsize impact on their health.

2024: The year of momentum and unlocking further personalization 

By continuing to strengthen our five key specialties and taking a disciplined approach to scale, we expect to achieve our 2025 EBITDA target of $100 million and have direct line of sight to  our revenue target of $1.2 billion. We are also tracking toward our first year of positive net income in 2024. Since the beginning, we’ve excelled at removing barriers and friction points such as lack of awareness, accessibility, and affordability. Our ability to achieve these milestones will be dictated by how we remove points of friction for not only users already seeking treatment today, but those who may be suffering but not seeking treatment. 

In 2024, we expect personalization will be foundational to unlocking new ways to reach users with more unique needs, like alternative form factors and unique dosages.  Medmatch by Hims & Hers will be a critical tool in giving both providers and consumers the confidence that a treatment can work for them, as the tool evolves to address one of the questions most top of mind for consumers: “has this solution worked for people like me?” 

All of these results to date and goals are important benchmarks, but they are truly just the beginning. My goal is to bring tens of millions of users to our platform because we know the huge scale—in the hundreds of millions in the US alone—of people who are suffering with the conditions we serve. I’m so proud of what we’re delivering at Hims & Hers and the positive outcomes we’re bringing to our customers, but more than that, I’m energized by the opportunity to bring this incredible experience to even more people in 2024.

We have relied upon the exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K and have not reconciled forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net loss, because we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain components of such reconciliations, including market-related assumptions that are not within our control, or others that may arise, without unreasonable effort. For these reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of future net loss.

4 Things to Know From Our Q2 Earnings Report

Written by

Andrew Dudum

August 5, 2024

As the possibilities for what healthcare can be for each individual transforms, we’re setting a new standard by introducing what we think truly personalized care can look like for every household in the US.

More people than ever are looking to us as their partner in leading healthier lives, and we see this by the amount of customers coming to our platform looking for a partner in every step of their health and wellness journey.

Today we shared that in the second quarter of 2024, we saw our business accelerate with more than 155,000 net new subscribers joining the platform. And we’re just getting started: we’re staying focused on building a best-in-class model that meets those evolving expectations by offering access to a diverse range of customized solutions through our platform and leveraging our scale to unlock widespread accessibility to those solutions.

Here’s what to know from today’s numbers and how we’re thinking about the coming quarters: 

We’re delivering value to our customers for their individual needs.

Our core business across five specialties is strong and continuing to grow, as evidenced by our nearly 1.9 million active total subscribers. 

We believe there’s no one size fits all solution in healthcare. Each customer should be treated as the individual that they are. That’s why 4 out of our 5 specialties now carry at least 10 personalized solutions. And we’re seeing that more than 40% of our subscribers use a personalized solution on the platform, indicating that our ability to provide access to high-quality personalized solutions at an affordable price is resonating with our customers across the board. The broad portfolio that providers can prescribe to patients on our platform is informed in part by feedback from our customers, and development occurs through collaboration with our internal specialists, leading medical organizations, and external advisers. More and more, we are driving value for our customers across a broader set of specialties as we expand into new capabilities and offerings.

New capabilities and offerings are ushering in a transformative moment for our company.

Growth at the rates we’re seeing means we’re clearly at an inflection point as a brand: we have the trust of a large customer base and we’re nurturing that trust with further innovation through personalized care. 

We’ve launched the capabilities to address multiple concerns within or across specialties and by expanding in this way, we're reaching a broader set of customers, and seeing stronger customer acquisition and retention. With personalized solutions available on our platform, providers can help our customers target multiple sexual health concerns, support cardiovascular health through a more simplified daily routine, or target concerns across our most popular specialties (Men’s Sexual Health and Hair) in a single once daily pill.

In the second quarter, more than 85% of new subscribers in our dermatology specialties were using a solution personalized for them, illustrating the real need for treatment customized to each customer. By enabling providers to individually tailor treatments to their patients as they deem appropriate, we’re breaking down barriers to accessing treatment for a broader set of customers, which further allows us to deliver low price points as we scale. (And we’re not stopping purely at price: we’re continuing to invest here, launching access to new multi-condition treatments and new form factors across our specialties.)

‍Weight Loss is emerging as a key part of how we impact our customers’ lives.

No conversation about this transformative moment for the company would be complete without discussing the impact our Weight Loss specialty has had on the business. Over 100 million individuals in the US suffer with weight-related challenges1, extending to serious health-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. We believe the Hims & Hers Weight Loss offering has the potential to meaningfully impact the lives of our customers and the way we can influence the healthcare industry.

A key part of our Weight Loss offering is the ability to provide customers with access to personalized compounded GLP-1 solutions. Hard-to-tolerate side effects, misunderstanding of reasonable results, cost, and accessibility all drive a worrying trend: one recent study shows that almost 60% of GLP-1 users terminate treatment within 3 months. Our offering is designed to help combat that drop-off in care by enabling consistent communication between providers and customers to manage expectations, and personalized titration schedules and end-dosing to balance side effect concerns. There are two key elements of that evolution:

Breadth of products offered on the platform: We recently launched access to personalized dosages for compounded semaglutide that providers can prescribe to help balance side effects based on feedback from their patients during their titration schedule. Together, the provider and patient can find the appropriate end-state dose that helps set the patient up for a more sustainable experience. We’re also expanding the scope of offerings available: in the second half of this year, certain branded medications will be available, and in the future, we’ll bring on other compounded GLP-1 injections, like Liraglutide.
Scaling our technology investments across Weight Loss: We’re in the process of activating MedMatch by Hims & Hers for providers in the specialty, which is a critical step as the range of solutions, dosages and treatment options continues to expand. Machine learning models can help providers understand the type of medication, the appropriate titration schedule, and the correct personalized end-dose, in each case that is more likely to lead to consumer success. With our existing machine learning and AI models anchored on customer preferences, prior experiences across our provider network, and publicly available inputs, we’ll see our models improve as the category grows. 

Since introducing access to compounded GLP-1 injections, we have seen strong business performance across our Weight Loss specialty – and that extends to our personalized non-GLP-1 oral-based solutions for Weight Loss. Our oral solutions have been incredibly successful on their own, in less than a year scaling to a run-rate of 100 million in annual revenue – our fastest specialty ever to do so. 

Our Weight Loss specialty (like all of our specialties) is built to improve as it grows – and we’re already seeing very exciting results across Weight Loss. Based upon self-reported data from approximately 12,000 customers subscribed to a holistic Hims & Hers weight loss offering, customers report having lost, on average, 10.2 pounds while on compounded GLP-1 injections and 6.3 pounds while on non-GLP-1 compounded oral medication kits between their initial weight at consultation and their first check-in approximately 4 weeks later. During this same period, less than 10% of customers using our GLP-1 offering have reported side effects that they feel they can't tolerate. 

This progress underlines the importance of a holistic approach, as each of our subscribers has access to personalized treatment plans based on lifestyle, eating pattern, health history and weight loss goals, and includes medications in addition to diet, exercise, and weight loss counseling and support. We believe these numbers are the floor, not the ceiling, of what we know we can help our customers achieve – we know we’re building the best, most sustainable experience customers can find in the industry.

We’re deepening our bench of experts.

The right team and expertise is critical for achieving true excellence and delivering life-changing impact to our customers. Investing in a world-class team will always be a priority. 

Our board is a group of diverse, experienced voices and with the recent additions of Chistopher Payne, Anja Manuel, and Kåre Schultz, we now have the experience and deep perspective on scaling tech companies, international expansion, and the pharmaceutical industry represented across our Board of Directors. 

We are transforming the way that customers can take control of their health and wellness, and I’m thrilled we can be the partner to more and more customers as they take that journey.

Affordable and Safe Weight Loss Care: How Hims & Hers is Delivering a new GLP-1 Experience

Written by

Andrew Dudum

May 20, 2024

By leveraging the size and scale of our platform, we can secure access to one of the highest-quality supplies of compounded GLP-1s available, easing the strain this shortage is placing on the millions of Americans who have obesity and are looking for help safely managing their weight.

The core of the Hims & Hers business is – and always has been – to offer a truly personalized experience that our customers can trust and rely on. We are ruthlessly committed to increasing access to personalized care for conditions that impact how people feel when they wake up every morning.

For nearly 7 years and over 20 million consultations on our platform since our founding, we’ve taken this customer-centric approach with all kinds of sensitive, challenging conditions: breaking down barriers to accessing care, whether through raising awareness, removing stigma, improving access channels, and meaningfully lowering the cost of high-quality care. Making GLP-1 medications available through our platform, which we’re announcing today, is very much in line with that ethos.

When we first built our weight loss solution, we prioritized access to non-GLP-1 treatments, including some that had been used for decades to successfully help people lose weight. We knew GLP-1s were not for everyone and the shortages across the industry made GLP-1s too expensive and too challenging to physically access. As we shared in our Q1 earnings date, this solution continues to perform as expected and is projected to generate over $100 million in revenue by 2025. However, it is now clear that the portfolio of GLP-1 drugs will remain in shortage for some amount of time – and at Hims & Hers, we believe any amount of time is too long to wait for the care you deserve and the treatments you need. 

The ongoing shortage of GLP-1 medications is placing an immense strain on the millions of Americans who have obesity, are looking for help, and cannot access the care that they deserve. Drugs that currently cost thousands out of pocket for a monthly supply can be accessed for much, much less – and at Hims & Hers we believe those savings should be passed to consumers. We conducted extensive research for over a year into the FDA’s exhaustive list of approved 503B pharmacies, putting rigorous standards in place for vetting and we’re now partnering with a leading US manufacturer of generic and 503B compounded injectable medications as our supplier for these drugs. We are leveraging our size and scale to secure access to one of the highest-quality supplies of compounded GLP-1s available today in order to be a part of easing the strain this shortage is placing on the millions of Americans who have obesity and are looking for help. 

Through our offering, we’re delivering a personalized approach for every customer that is affordable and built to deliver successful outcomes. 

Many of the current challenges with GLP-1s are driven by persistent shortages, arbitrarily high costs of medications, providers’ inability to truly personalize treatments based on their individual patients’ responses, and a one-size-fits-all approach to dosing. The elements preventing us from building a GLP-1 offering – pricing, availability of the active ingredients, confidence in the quality of the compounded versions of the drugs – have evolved significantly over the last year and, given our success over the last few quarters, we have found a way to mitigate those challenges on the behalf of our customers. We’ve always said that we feel it’s important to be the best in market, rather than simply the first in market.

Over the last year, we have grown in our conviction – based on our medical experts’ evaluation and the strength of our infrastructure – that if done properly, compounded GLP-1s are safe and effective. Similar to our extensive work in mental health where we’ve served hundreds of thousands of customers, we know that not all medications are right for all people, which means a broader offering that focuses on personalization in treatment is necessary for great outcomes. We have taken a holistic approach to weight loss because we are committed to providing a comprehensive set of options so individuals and their providers can find a solution that is right for them. That means (in addition to sleep, movement and nutrition tools) offering the option of oral medications, compounded GLP-1s, or branded GLP-1 medications (as supply becomes more readily available), so that customers can truly personalize their experience. 

Starting today, we are providing access to compounded GLP-1 treatments for eligible customers at prices starting at $199/monthly. We are providing access to compounded GLP-1s, which means customers can access the same active ingredient as Ozempic and Wegovy without navigating the shortages that are currently limiting access to the medication. However, we know that some customers will still prefer a branded medication, so we’re built to offer access to those as well, as supply becomes more readily available. Through our offering, we’re delivering a personalized approach for every customer that is affordable and built to deliver successful outcomes. 

Our experience serving more than 1.7M subscribers1, combined with our infrastructure, gives us confidence that this is the best time to begin offering access to GLP-1s. After a year of evaluating this space with our clinical partners, we believe we can deliver equal – if not better – experiences for the millions of people who deserve to find success with a solution that has been personalized for their needs. This is another chance for us to make good on our promise to customers of access to affordable, available treatments that meet our high clinical standards, and I can’t wait to see the lives we impact.

Building On Hims & Hers’ Comprehensive Approach to Weight Loss

Written by

Craig Primack, MD, FACP, FAAP, FOMA

November 21, 2024

At Hims & Hers, we’re focused on delivering our customers access to end-to-end, sustainable care that includes life-changing solutions to help them enjoy success in the long-term. As part of that commitment, our objective is to not only help our customers achieve their weight loss goals, but to feel healthier overall.

For too long, the current healthcare systems in America have tried to pin the country’s ongoing obesity crisis on individual failures or a personal lack of willpower. Those systems have tried to address the issue by getting people to stick to unsustainable fad diets, an impersonal, “one-size-fits-all” approach, and medications that are too expensive for most people to access. And when that approach doesn’t work, or the weight comes back, it’s often the individual that blames themselves. Not at Hims & Hers.

Throughout my 20 years of medical experience in obesity care and working with thousands of patients, I have seen first-hand the difference that a comprehensive, individually-tailored treatment approach makes in people’s weight loss journeys. Every person’s experiences and needs are unique to them – their care should be, too. And, most importantly, every person should be able to access that care. 

That’s why at Hims & Hers, we’re focused on delivering our customers access to end-to-end, sustainable care that includes life-changing solutions to help them enjoy success in the long-term. As part of that commitment, our objective is to not only help our customers achieve their weight loss goals, but to feel healthier overall.  

Based on self-reported data, this approach is making a massive impact in the lives of many Hims & Hers customers, who are enjoying the benefits of holistic, sustainable treatment plans that take every aspect of their health into account, including movement, sleep, behavioral and psychological support, medication, and nutrition.

Nutrition is crucial to healthy and sustainable weight management, but it can often go overlooked by individuals trying to stay on top of it on their own. Throughout the process of losing weight, especially on GLP-1 medications, it can be common to experience the loss of muscle mass. If that muscle mass continues to diminish, it can develop into a condition called sarcopenia. To maintain muscle mass, a protein-rich and nutrient-dense diet is crucial.

To help our customers stay on top of their protein and nutrient intake and simplify access to the critical nutrition support they need, today we announced that customers on a prescribed weight loss plan from Hims & Hers will now be able to have meal replacement bars and shakes delivered directly to their doorstep. Introducing nutrition support subscriptions represents another example of our commitment to taking care of our customers’ health holistically. 

In addition to meal replacements, nutrition support subscriptions include meal plans, recipes, and other nutritional support resources developed by dieticians and nutritionists tailored to each individual’s eating profile and preferences. As a part of their weight loss plan, customers will also have 24/7 access to a dedicated care team to support them on their journey. 

At Hims & Hers, we are in constant pursuit of elevating how we serve our customers by finding more ways to make achieving their health and wellness goals more accessible and sustainable. Our comprehensive, individualized approach is helping us continue to shift the paradigm in weight loss and empowering people to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a program unlike any available.

From increasing access to personalized, comprehensive care and making affordable solutions and support more available, the work we’re doing alongside our customers is revolutionizing the way obesity is being treated in America. 

And our journey to create a better future of healthcare together is just getting started.

Announcing Hard Mints – A Highly Personalized Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction
February 7, 2023

New compounded prescription chewables from Hims are formulated with fast-acting and long-lasting ingredients.

Today, Hims & Hers announced Hard Mints by Hims, a compounded chewable, mint-flavored prescription tablet in a variety of dosages, will be available later this year.

Hard Mints are designed to give providers more options in finding the best outcomes for their patients experiencing symptoms of erectile dysfunction. Leveraging the same active ingredients as Cialis©, Viagra©, Levitra© and Stayxn©, Hard Mints by Hims is a highly personalized treatment that can be tailored to each individual’s health needs and preferences by their medical provider.

“Personalizing medication—by combining active pharmaceutical ingredients and customizing dosing within innovative medication formats to meet individual medical needs—is going to transform healthcare,” said Dr. Peter Stahl, Urologist and Senior Vice President of Men’s Reproductive & Sexual Health at Hims & Hers. “We have been focused on delivering highly personalized health solutions, a journey that has led us to introducing Hard Mints by Hims. This innovative offering will benefit those who have erectile dysfunction by empowering providers to take every aspect of an individual's health and expressed preferences into consideration in order to provide a more personalized treatment for that individual’s clinical needs.”

The wintergreen-flavored prescribed sets of the Hard Mints by Hims will be available starting at $30 per month. Active ingredients of the prescription variations include:

Vardenafil: fast-acting with the same active ingredients as Levitra© and Stayxn©.
Tadalafil: long-lasting, now offered through Hims as either a daily or as-needed chewable with the same active ingredients as Cialis©.
Combination Tadalafil and Sildenafil: Tadalafil is both fast-acting and long-lasting. This combination includes the same active ingredients as Cialis© and Viagra© in a unique formulation.

“Healthcare isn’t one-size-fits-all, and that’s true of medicine as well. At Hims & Hers, we are committed to helping individuals achieve their health and wellness goals by providing access to an approachable experience with highly personalized treatments,” said Dr. Scott Knoer, Chief Pharmacy and Innovation Officer at Hims & Hers. “Hard Mints by Hims is a testament to the momentum we’re building through prescription product innovation. With this medication form factor and packaging, we’ve set out to shatter the stigma associated with erectile dysfunction medication and help people feel more confident when it comes to taking care of themselves.”

Building Our Pharmacy Operations with the Customer in Mind

Written by

Melissa Baird

September 9, 2024

Solutions like Hard Mints, Hair Blends, Heart Health by Hims, and personalized GLP-1 doses are the result of our thoughtful approach to pharmacy operations, and our customers feel the difference.

We know customers want to be treated as individuals. Personalized care isn’t just a trend or a gimmick: many of our customers initially come to us looking for help with a single issue, but they are often struggling with multiple conditions simultaneously, or have intolerable side effects to commercially available doses of medicine.

These patients can all benefit from a personalized solution. One of the ways we are able to offer a truly personalized experience for our customers is by innovating across our platform, including investing in our pharmacy operations as a scalable infrastructure that makes personalized care accessible to more individuals, without sacrificing quality or safety. 

Solutions like Hard Mints, Hair Blends, Heart Health by Hims, and personalized GLP-1 doses are the result of our thoughtful approach to pharmacy operations, and our customers feel the difference: as of the end of the second quarter, more than 785,000 customers now subscribe to a personalized solution on our platform. 

We’re able to offer access to tailored solutions to each customer’s individual needs through our 503A compounding pharmacies located in Ohio and Arizona. Whether it’s adjusting dosage, removing allergens, or even combining multiple medications into one, these facilities formulate solutions for the individual. The ingredients used are carefully researched and sourced in order to make sure that they are high quality, and we verify that each active ingredient complies with specifications set by the United States Pharmacopeia, which is an independent, not-for-profit organization that sets quality and safety standards for medicine. We also test formulations with a third-party analytical laboratory, ensuring that the potency and strength in the formulation is as labeled. Across both pharmacies, we have a team of more than 70 pharmacists and nearly 150 pharmacy technicians. 

As we scale and make world-class personalized care accessible to more people, our priority remains the safety and success of each customer. We are committed to offering affordable, safe, and effective solutions that meet the high standards our customers expect. Our expert teams also ensure the fulfillment and dispensing of all compounded products is done in compliance with applicable federal and state laws. Our 503A pharmacies are regulated by their respective state Boards of Pharmacy, meet strict FDA 503A requirements, and are run by world-class teams who are dedicated to maintaining a safe, clean, efficient environment. 

As we continue to expand the breadth of personalized solutions we offer, we’ve expanded our pharmacy operation capabilities through our acquisition of MedisourceRx, a 503B outsourcing facility in California. With expertise in sterile compounding, this 503B facility allows us to expand our sterile compounding offering and further reassure customers that they are getting access to an experience and products that meet our stringent standards for safety and quality.1 503B facilities follow FDA’s stringent current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations and the U.S. Pharmacopeia 797 requirements for sterile pharmaceutical compounding, which are designed to ensure products are sterile and consistent. This additional facility gives us the ability to continue to deliver on sterile compounded products like GLP-1 injections, and as we continue to expand our specialities, introduce access to new sterile compounded products in the coming years.  

We’re building for what we believe the future of healthcare should look like. Strengthening our infrastructure is just one more step in providing individuals access to the personalized solutions that gets them closer to the outcome that is right for them.

Building the Future of Healthcare: Our Roadmap to $6.5B

Written by

Andrew Dudum

May 5, 2025

What began as a simpler way to access care has grown into a technology-driven platform reshaping how care is delivered, built to support millions of people across a wide and expanding range of health needs.

Not long ago, a customer wrote in after starting treatment through Hers. What stuck with me was how she put it: “From the start, I felt like I was in good hands that cared about me personally.” Over the years, I’ve seen so many people come to our platform looking for help feeling better in their bodies. As we’ve grown and added new specialties, I’ve been inspired, not just by how far we’ve come as a company, but by the real progress our customers are making in their health and lives.

At Hims & Hers, our mission has always been clear: make healthcare accessible, more affordable, and more personal. What began as a simpler way to access care has grown into a technology-driven platform reshaping how care is delivered, built to support millions of people across a wide and expanding range of health needs.

Today, alongside our Q1 results, we shared something even more important: our vision for the future. A roadmap for what this company can become, and how we plan to get there.

We’ve set a bold target: $6.5 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in Adjusted EBITDA by 2030. That number reflects our ambition – but also our conviction. It’s grounded in what we’ve already built, the trust we’ve earned, and the scale we’re starting to unlock.

These aren’t just numbers. They’re grounded in a proven model, a strong foundation, and a fast-growing, loyal customer base. More than that, they reflect the increasing role we can play in helping people take control of their daily health in the U.S. and around the world.

This is our roadmap. To get there, we’re focused on five priorities, each unlocking new ways to serve our customers more deeply and more broadly.

More Personalized Care for Every Individual

The future of care should be built for you, and it should feel like that. We’re already offering hundreds of personalized treatments, and we’re just scratching the surface. Over the next few years, we expect to expand that to thousands, powered by lab testing, wearable data, and AI. The goal: faster feedback, better outcomes, and care that adapts to each person’s unique needs.

Expanding Into the Health Issues That Matter Most

We’ve seen incredible momentum in areas like weight loss, which we believe is proof that when care is simple and personalized, people engage. This year, we plan to expand into conditions like low testosterone and menopause, which affect millions. With lab testing and new treatment capabilities for providers, we’re also exploring new areas like longevity, sleep, and preventive care, all focused on helping people feel their best over the long term.

Smarter, Scalable Care, Without Losing the Human Touch

As we grow, we stay personal. Tools like MedMatch by Hims & Hers and clever routing are improving how providers engage with their patients, and we’re building AI-powered support across therapy, nutrition, and coaching, so every experience feels seamless, proactive, and human. The future of care puts people first. It connects diagnosis, treatment, and delivery in a way that feels seamless, supportive, and tailored to each individual. That’s the future we’re building.

Teaming Up With the Best in Healthcare

Our collaboration with Novo Nordisk shows what’s possible when trusted medicine meets personalized care. But we’re going further. We’re building an ecosystem, connecting pharma partners, clinical providers, and our platform, to deliver the best healthcare experience possible. We’re confident in our ability to be the ecosystem player that helps everyone win, while delivering access to the best care for the people we serve.

Taking Our Model Global

Healthcare challenges are global, and so is demand for simpler, more transparent, more personalized healthcare. Our early success in the UK gives us confidence we can scale globally, to offer access to personalized, transparent, high-quality care to people everywhere. More on that soon.

We’re entering a new era of growth, defined by deeper personalization, broader impact, and a relentless focus on the customer. From expanding diagnostics to launching entirely new specialties, we’re evolving fast, with more speed, more precision, and more ambition than ever before.

The foundation is built. The roadmap is clear. And we’re just getting started.

Cultural Competence for Weight Loss Care

Written by

Craig Primack, MD, FACP, FAAP, FOMA

August 22, 2024

At Hims & Hers we strive to make sure our customers feel safe, welcomed and that they receive exceptional service and care through our platform.

Hims & Hers was started to eliminate stigmas around health and wellness issues and break down barriers for people when it comes to accessing personalized healthcare. And part of that is recognizing, understanding and respecting the values and beliefs of our customers and communicating effectively across cultures to create deeper connections with our customers to better help them understand the care they can access through our platform.

Cultural competence is a practice in health care to deliver services that meet patients' cultural, social and religious needs. Cultural competence for weight loss is an important aspect of healthcare that can help improve communication and understanding when treating patients with weight-related issues. 

At Hims & Hers, cultural competence is an important pillar of the training the licensed healthcare professionals receive so our customers feel comfortable, safe and respected when they come to our platform for their health and wellness goals.  

The ACTION Study

The ACTION (Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management) Study is the first multidisciplinary study to explore the attitude and behaviors about obesity. The study looks at people with obesity, health care professionals, and employers and the barriers of obesity care.

There are typically 5 key barriers to obesity care:

People with obesity make multiple attempts to lose weight, but can not maintain it
People with obesity think that weight loss is their own responsibility
Many people with obesity have not received a formal diagnosis of obesity, therefore it's not addressed properly1
People with obesity tend to skip follow-up appointments for obesity care
Employer wellness programs are not meeting the needs of people with obesity, insurance coverage is minimal for obesity related care 

People with obesity typically have a belief that weight loss is their responsibility and they are oftentimes reluctant to seek care, as they can feel ashamed or embarrassed. This embarrassment can come from friends, family and even medical professionals. Unfortunately, there is often stigma and bias towards people living with obesity. Living with obesity can also stand in the way of people getting the high-quality care they deserve. Biases against people with weight issues can make a medical professional less sympathetic, supportive, and compassionate, which may compromise the level of care they deliver. Due to this, people living with obesity may be less likely to seek medical help for their weight and health related problems. 

Through research we know that more collaborative efforts are necessary for effective obesity care.1 The barriers identified in the ACTION Study highlight the need for better understanding of obesity and more effective solutions for obesity care. For more information on the ACTION Study, visit: https://www.rethinkobesity.com/advocacy-resources/the-action-study.html 

Hims & Hers

At Hims & Hers we strive to make sure our customers feel safe, welcomed and that they receive exceptional service and care through our platform. From the comfort of their homes, patients are able to connect with licensed healthcare professionals on our platform to seek personalized treatment and care for their health issues and not feel embarrassed or ashamed. Customers do not have to call for an appointment where they have to openly talk about their health issues, wait weeks to see a doctor, feel embarrassed when they are sitting in the waiting room or when they are having face to face conversations with a doctor who may have biases towards them. Our platform takes away the stigma that is associated with many of these uncomfortable conversations, and allows individuals to focus on getting the treatments they deserve in a safe, affordable and accessible way so they can start their journey to a healthier life. 

Here are some ways that we encourage providers on our platform to apply cultural competence when engaging with their weight loss patients: 

Be aware of biases: Be aware of your own biases and be able to separate individual and group differences. 
Use patient-first language: A way of writing and speaking about obesity that avoids labeling people with their condition, for example, “the patient is living with obesity” or “patient with obesity”, instead of the obese patient.  
Gather information: Learn about the beliefs, social norms, and practices of different groups through observation, conversations. 
Consider cultural connections: Consider cultural connections to food, as well as other values and beliefs. 
Use native language: Use the patient's native language whenever possible. 
Involve patients: Ask patients what they prefer and involve them in important decisions about their health. 
Align with personal views: Communications about treatment methods and interventions should align with a patient's personal views to ensure recommendations are culturally appropriate. 

Hims & Hers was created to make sure everyone feels great through the power of better health. We believe in breaking stigmas and removing barriers to health so that individuals are able to receive care without feeling shame or embarrassment. And it's never been more urgent than it is right now with the global obesity epidemic we are in.

First Look: How Hims & Hers Customers Are Seeing Positive Outcomes with Personalized Weight Loss

Written by

Dr. Pat Carroll & Dr. Jessica Yu

October 29, 2024

Data from Hims & Hers' latest white paper outlines how customers are achieving positive outcomes within our weight loss program. Early customer results indicate they are managing side effects well, staying on treatment, and overall feeling healthier.

The United States is facing an urgent public health crisis: obesity. Over 40% of American adults—more than 100 million people—experience obesity, and projections suggest that nearly 80% may experience being overweight by 2030. This rise is fueled by an “obesogenic” environment: inexpensive, nutrient-poor food, limited access to physical activity, and social norms that encourage unhealthy behaviors. Addressing this epidemic requires a comprehensive approach that includes accessible, patient-centered care and medications that are effective, cost-effective, and consistently available. Data from Hims & Hers Weight Loss: A Look at Early Customer Experiences and Outcomes outlines how customers are achieving positive outcomes within our weight loss program. Early customer results indicate they are managing side effects well, staying on treatment, and overall feeling healthier.  

Since December 2023, Hims & Hers has provided its customers access to personalized weight loss solutions through a comprehensive program that includes medication management, holistic support, digital tools, and convenient access to a care team. We offer access to personalized treatments based on individual goals, history, and preferences, including compounded oral medications and GLP-1s. Our platform also provides nutrition, exercise, mental health resources, sleep guidance, and progress tracking for hydration, movement, and sleep—all within the Hims & Hers app.

The results speak for themselves: We’ve analyzed self-reported data from thousands of customers as of October 1st, 2024 and found that that customers have experienced meaningful results while using personalized treatment through our weight loss program. Oral medication customers reported having lost an average of 7.5 pounds by Day 28 and 9 pounds by Day 56, while compounded GLP-1 customers reported having lost 9.3 pounds in the first month, and 12.5 pounds by Day 56. Additionally, 92% of oral medication users and 93% of GLP-1 users at Day 56 reported feeling healthier, experiencing improvements in health conditions, confidence, and mood. Notably, customers who have tried other traditional weight loss methods have found success with our program. For example, in a survey of 3,013 oral medication customers and 920 GLP-1 customers, only 9% of oral medication users and 29% of GLP-1 customers had previously tried prescription weight loss medications, with cost and availability often being barriers.

Our solutions are also sustainable. As of October 1st, 2024, only 13% of Hims & Hers GLP-1 customers have canceled their subscription within the first month. A Blue Cross study unrelated to Hims & Hers found that 30% of patients on commercially available options discontinued their treatment in the same time frame. We believe this low rate is due to the ability for providers to prescribe tailored, titrated dosing, which can help with side effect management by gradually adjusting doses based on individual tolerance. Our comprehensive support system—covering nutrition, exercise, mental health, and sleep—ensures that patients can maintain their progress and achieve long-term results.

These results demonstrate that personalized, compounded solutions can deliver meaningful weight loss and broader health benefits with the goal of significantly reducing discontinuation rates. Titrated dosing and a dedicated care team can help customers manage these effects early. This support helps them stay on track for long-term success. Our ability to provide access to tailored medications to meet each customer’s unique needs, combined with ongoing support through regular communication, compliance monitoring, and holistic lifestyle coaching, has been key to this success. 

Providing access to safe, affordable weight loss solutions is more critical than ever. Like with every health category we offer our customers, we are committed to building a treatment solution that includes safe and affordable ingredients that are consistently available and effective. We’re just at the beginning of our weight journey along with our customers, and it’s exciting to see their tremendous success with Hims & Hers weight loss program.

Continuous innovation and consumer insights were key in developing our newest personalized offering, Sex Rx + Climax Control. The launch of Sex Rx + Climax Control enables providers to prescribe a compounded 2-in-1 medication designed to help men address multiple aspects of sexual satisfaction without the need to take multiple pills.

“While our providers have had great success treating erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation with currently available prescription medications, we believe there is opportunity to continue to improve quality of care and treatment outcomes by offering providers and consumers the ability to access new innovative, personalized treatments,” said Dr. Peter J. Stahl, MD, SVP Men’s Reproductive & Sexual Health, Hims. “Sex Rx + Climax Control will further empower providers on our platform to provide best in class care for men with premature ejaculation, both with and without erectile dysfunction.“

83% of Hims users who say they want to last longer also want stronger, more satisfying erections*

In a deep dive conversation with Dr. Peter Stahl, he gives an overview of erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE), answers common questions on the conditions, and shares more on why Sex Rx + Climax Control can be an option for individuals experiencing multiple aspects of sexual dysfunction. 

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are very common and can affect a large population of men. According to large national and multinational studies, ED affects up to 30% of young men and more than 50% of men aged 40–70, and PE affects approximately 30% of all men. With so many men experiencing these conditions, we know it’s an important subject to discuss, but not always easy to talk about. 

What are the symptoms of ED and PE?

ED very specifically refers to the condition when a man sometimes or often experiences difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection. Other sexual dysfunctions like PE or loss of sexual desire often coexist with ED, but they are distinct and separate conditions. PE is a different clinical condition that can vary in how it is described, but generally refers to men having short ejaculatory latency times (less than a few minutes), a sense that they lack control over ejaculation, and personal or relationship distress related to fast ejaculation.  

What age groups deal with ED and PE?

All age groups of men are affected by ED and PE. For ED specifically, there are definite differences in prevalence and pathophysiology when you break up the population by age. In general, ED is less prevalent in younger men than in older men. That’s because vascular, hormonal, and nerve problems that impair penile function usually develop over time as men age and accumulate other medical problems. PE, on the other hand, is more common and bothersome in younger men. 

Is PE related to ED?

PE is a different, distinct clinical condition that is also very common. It often gets confused with ED, especially when affected men ejaculate quickly and then experience the totally normal and natural difficulty in achieving a second erection immediately after an orgasm (during the refractory period). However, one of the most common forms of PE is acquired PE that develops in men with ED as a compensatory mechanism. You can think of it as the brain and body subconsciously realizing that ejaculation needs to happen quickly before they inevitably lose their erection because of ED.  

At what point should someone see a physician about issues they are having that may be related to ED or PE?

Everyone can have a bad day. Single or rare isolated instances of failing to get or maintain an erection, or of losing control and ejaculating very quickly, are totally normal and can occur for a variety of reasons (stress, lack of sleep, a new partner, etc.). A good rule of thumb is that a person should seek professional help if they find they are worrying a lot about sexual performance or avoiding partnered sexual activity due to fear that they won’t be able to meet their partner’s expectations. This is very common and again, nothing to be embarrassed about. 

Is it important for someone who is, for the first time, seeking treatment for ED or PE to visit a medical professional in-person? Why or why not?

We are learning every day about what conditions can appropriately be managed with virtual care outside of conventional in-person visits. As a fellowship-trained and experienced expert in male sexual health that has treated a lot of men, I’ve come to strongly believe that ED and PE can be safely and effectively treated without an in-person visit in most cases. In fact, I think virtual care has many advantages over in-person care for the initial treatment and evaluation of ED and PE. 

‍Barriers to care like embarrassment or needing to take time off from work are alleviated — that makes care for sensitive issues like sexual dysfunction much more accessible and approachable. I believe that technology can also enhance quality and safety by standardizing intake and ensuring that the right information is gathered from a patient so that the treating provider has the information that they need to make evidence-based, personalized treatment decisions. Overall, virtual care is a great way to initiate evaluation and treatment for ED and PE. 

Can any non-Rx treatment help those struggling ED and PE?

There are some non-prescription interventions that can help with ED and PE. Sleeping enough, eating well, and avoiding behaviors like smoking cigarettes that impair sexual function are great first steps. Weight loss in overweight or obese men can improve sexual performance. Sex therapy can be important for men in whom ED and PE results from psychological factors like anxiety about sexual performance. Certain dietary supplements may help with erectile function, though improvement in sexual function is much smaller than improvement seen with prescription ED and PE medication. There are also some effective OTC treatments for both ED and PE like vacuum erection devices for ED, and topical numbing agents for PE.

At what point, or for what reasons, do healthcare providers feel it’s recommended to prescribe ED or PE medication?

The decision to start ED or PE medication is a highly personalized, shared decision between a patient and their healthcare provider. Since the available ED or PE medications are effective and generally low risk, my personal opinion is that they should be strongly considered for any man of any age who is consistently or episodically struggling with sexual performance. It is important to note that treatment with oral medication is an appropriate option for sexual dysfunction irrespective of the cause of that sexual dysfunction. For example, oral medications can be a great treatment for ED or PE even when it has a non-physical, psychogenic cause. Sometimes, that’s exactly what men need to get their confidence back and eventually regain their normal sexual function without the need for medication. 

What types of ED or PE treatments can someone obtain from visiting with a healthcare provider through Hims? Are these treatments safe?

Hims provides access to licensed healthcare providers who can evaluate and treat men who have ED by itself, ED and PE at the same time, or PE by itself. Our partnered healthcare providers are trained to provide evidence-based prescription treatments personalized to the unique needs, situations and preferences of each individual patient. For ED, they can prescribe commercially available medications like Viagra® or Cialis®, or their generic versions sildenafil or tadalafil, or more personalized compounded medications that might be better suited to an individual person. For example, a provider might prescribe a medication that contains both fast acting and long-lasting active ingredients for a patient with an unpredictable sex life, or a provider might prescribe a chewable tablet for a person who wants to be able to discreetly take their medication at the right moment without needing a glass of water. Just like for ED, providers on the Hims platform can prescribe commercially available medications for patients with PE alone or PE and ED at the same time. Depending on the clinical scenario, this might include medications that improve penile blood flow like Cialis or Viagra (or their generic versions), or medications that delay ejaculation like sertraline or paroxetine. They can also prescribe more personalized compounded medications to serve an individual patient’s unique needs, including through the Sex Rx + Climax Control offering, which enables providers to use a 2-in-1 approach to the medication.

What can someone expect from a virtual visit about ED or PE via Hims?

Hims provides a secure platform through which consumers can access licensed healthcare providers who conduct telehealth evaluations. The initial portion of the visit consists of answering questions about their general health and their condition, in this case ED or PE, and providing additional information that may be necessary to complete the process. The intake process is designed to collect all of the clinical information needed to inform high-quality medical decision-making in an efficient way, and to provide consumers with additional information about some of the potential medications that their provider has the ability to prescribe through the platform, including the cost of potential treatments. Once an individual completes the intake process and submits their information, the patient’s clinical information is evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine whether they are a good candidate for treatment through the platform, and if so, which prescription treatment is appropriate. The consumer and healthcare provider have the opportunity to communicate back and forth to provide any necessary clarifications and to answer any questions. If treatment is recommended, the provider can write a prescription and treatment will be delivered directly to the consumer within a few days. After an initial prescription is written, each patient’s care subscription includes ongoing 24/7 ability to message our partnered providers and their care team, as well as regular online check-ins and follow up appointments to ensure that continued care is safe and effective.  

Why should people trust medical professionals providing care through the Hims platform to safely diagnose and treat ED?

The healthcare providers that the Hims platform connects to patients are carefully vetted and fully credentialed US licensed healthcare providers. Each provider undergoes additional training in any condition that they are treating through our platform. In addition, Hims has leveraged expert physicians (like me!) to help develop platform features, clinical guideline statements and reference documents that are readily accessible to guide clinical care. We also have a highly structured quality and audit program that is very similar to quality programs found in large brick and mortar healthcare organizations. In fact, we’ve reviewed and audited over 1 million clinical interactions so far. All of these factors allow us to monitor and maintain high standards of care for all of the conditions that are treated through our platform.

From Roots to Ritual: Meet the Biotin + Minoxidil Gummy through Hers

Written by

Dr. Jessica Shepherd, MD

June 17, 2025

The Minoxidil + Biotin Gummy through Hers is the first-ever prescription hair regrowth gummy, representing a major step forward in delivering the convenient, personalized health solutions women deserve.

As Chief Medical Officer at Hers, I've dedicated my career as an OB-GYN of 20 years to address women's health concerns—issues too often dismissed, underserved, and left without meaningful innovation. I've seen firsthand the profound impact of hair loss that millions of women face. It's a journey often marked by pain and stigma. Today, we’re charting a different course by introducing a bold innovation in personalized women's hair care: the Biotin + Minoxidil Gummy through Hers. As the first-ever prescription hair regrowth gummy1, it represents a major step forward in delivering the convenient, personalized health solutions women deserve to treat their unique needs.

From its core ingredients, to its delicious green apple flavor, to its sleek, elegant packaging, every detail of the Biotin + Minoxidil Gummy through Hers was considered to create a convenient, modern, and delightful solution built with women’s unique preferences in mind.

This groundbreaking gummy solution is setting a new standard in personalized treatment. Formulated by dermatologists, it combines prescription-strength minoxidil, a doctor-trusted ingredient to kickstart hair regrowth, and biotin, a key B vitamin that supports healthy hair, skin, and nails. Together, the gummy is a once-daily dose that’s designed to help women stick to their prescribed hair regimens as deemed clinically necessary by their provider to address their individual needs. From its core ingredients, to its delicious green apple flavor, to its sleek, elegant packaging, every detail was considered to create a convenient, modern, and delightful solution built with women’s unique preferences in mind. Because the truth is, it doesn’t matter how well a medication works if it's not taken consistently. Our mission was to give providers another option to address the unique needs of their patients in making available a treatment designed to foster habit through genuine desire, not forced routine.

One of the most exciting aspects of this gummy solution is the science behind it. By leveraging the power of personalization, we’re making it possible for women to access treatment designed to address their individual needs for their unique body, lifestyle, and goals. This is the benefit of compounding. Whether it is increasing adherence to treatment by creating a new form factor, adjusting dosage strengths to reduce the risk of side effects or enabling the expert combination of safely available ingredients to target multiple clinical needs, compounding ensures treatments aren’t one-size-fits-all. They’re personal.

At Hers, we're proud to be at the forefront of women's health, focusing on key areas like mental health, weight management, dermatology, and hair care. And today’s launch of the Biotin + Minoxidil Gummy through Hers shows what's possible when innovation meets intention. We're building a future where women get comprehensive, personalized care, empowering them to live their healthiest, most vibrant lives.

From Running 10Ks to Gaining Confidence, Hims & Hers Customers Share Wins on Weight Loss Journeys
January 22, 2025

The growing community of Hims & Hers weight loss customers are feeling healthier and achieving meaningful personal goals that transcend numbers on the scale.

With over two million subscribers* and counting, the Hims & Hers platform is a growing community of individuals who are experiencing firsthand the power of feeling great through better health. With a relentless focus on making personalized care more accessible and sustainable, Hims & Hers is committed to serving our community of customers wherever they are on their health journey.

Personalized weight loss solutions are one part of our comprehensive offering that includes medication management, holistic support, digital tools, and convenient, always-on access to a care team. Through both our Hims and Hers platform, we offer access to personalized treatments, including compounded oral medications and GLP-1s, based on a customer’s individual goals, history, and preferences.** Our program also provides nutrition, exercise, mental health resources, sleep guidance, and progress tracking for hydration, movement, and sleep—all within the Hims and Hers apps.

We know weight weighs heavily on the minds and moods of Americans. In our Shape of America report released last December, we asked Americans which areas of their life have been impacted, either positively or negatively, by their physical fitness or weight. Mental health topped their list, coming in above other areas in their life, such as their sense of self, sex lives, relationships, finances, and more. Our weight loss programs are built with this relationship in mind, and in October of 2024, we published a white paper outlining how our customers are achieving positive health outcomes – both physically and mentally – within our weight loss program. 

As our community of members continues to grow, so do their unique stories. Whether it’s running their first 10K, decreasing chronic pain, or simply having more energy to go about their day, Hims & Hers weight loss customers are feeling healthier and achieving meaningful personal goals that transcend a number on the scale. 

While we’re thrilled to see the success and growth of our Weight Loss program, what’s most important is the progress our customers are seeing and feeling. It’s their experiences that we are focused on. Ashley, Zach and Kimberly are a few of the thousands in the Hims & Hers community who are seeing a life-changing impact from their personalized weight loss plans:

Note: Customers may have been compensated for their opinion. Results shared by customers who have purchased varying products, including prescription-based products. Customers’ results have not been independently verified. Individual results will vary.

Ashley

Ashley chose Hers because she knew they would understand her specific needs. Prior to starting her program, Ashley took medication for blood pressure, but after four months with Hers, she’s lost 36 pounds and no longer has to use it. 

""I just wanted to feel like myself again and get my confidence back. Four months in, I have more energy and feel much more confident than I have since I was in my twenties!""

Zach

Zach dealt with myriad health problems before coming to Hims and losing 120 lbs in nine months. Through this journey, he was able to reach a meaningful personal milestone when he ran his first 10K. Beyond the significant weight loss on the scale, Zach reports feeling better and healthier than ever.  

“I am the healthiest I’ve ever been. I am the fittest I have ever been. Hims has changed my life.”

Kimberly

Kimberly is down over 50 pounds and says starting her personalized program is one of the best decisions she’s made. Having her plan tailored to her needs alongside 24/7 access to a dedicated care team has helped Kimberly feel supported on her journey. 

“I’ve been impressed with how personalized and supportive the process has been. I felt listened to, and my concerns were taken seriously, which made me more confident in staying on track with my goals.""

Whatever goals our customers may have, we know having access to a care program that’s built around their specific needs is critical to finding and maintaining success. As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to continue supporting our growing community and helping them achieve their health and wellness goals, one step at a time.
